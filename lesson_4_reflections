When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you are working with mutiple people in multiple areas or using differnt
     computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Incase someone else has made changes to the repository and they would affect your work


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are when you have two differnt versions of a program, clones
    are just cloned repositores of one. Forks is made by github where you
    can clone others repositores and modify that without messing with the original


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

   It makes it eaiser for merging the repositores

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably use google docs. It would be hard to deal with merges and a similar
	merge issue such as the ones they talked about in the video

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You would want to make changes if you have a differnt version you are working with.
	Benefits allow you to make smaller changes that won't affect the whole thing 
	until you know its working. Although then you will have to update later.
