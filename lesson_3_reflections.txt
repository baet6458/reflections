What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository it creates a workspace locally
	to start tracking files
	and allows you to see what files have been committed. We need it to 
	track files and see which ones are commited

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is different from the working directory and repository
	because it doesn't submit it to the repository but its already out of
	the working directory so if you make any changes in the working directory
	it won't change the one in the staging area. It allows you to have 
	different versions of the same document for branching.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
