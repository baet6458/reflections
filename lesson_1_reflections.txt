How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	
	It helped me because it gave me the exact changes that occured between the two of them.

How could having easy acess to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	It helps because you can easily revert to changes when done testing but also lets you keep track of a projects progression

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in git, vs having versions automatically saved, like google docs does?
	
	Pros: It allows us to manually track and submit all of the changes we have made in a group
	
	cons: If we don't commit often enough it will be hard to go through all the changes that were made between files

Why do you think some version control systems,like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like google docs, treat each file separately?

	Some programs such as git are made for programming where you will have multiple files. Where google targets people using word documents or powerpoints. they don't necessarily need to change a document that affects another.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	You can get the log to find differnt version and use git diff with two differennt versions to view the differences between the two docs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	It would make it eaesy to revert to an older working version so you can either revert or see the differences and fix what you broke

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using git for?
